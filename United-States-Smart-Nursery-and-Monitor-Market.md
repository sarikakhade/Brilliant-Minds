The growing number of millennial parents, who are more likely to purchase smart nursery products through online platforms, has led to the increase in online sales. Additionally, traditional retail channels such as hypermarkets and specialty stores remain important as they offer customers the ability to experience products firsthand before making a purchase decision.</p> <h2>Smart Nursery and Monitor Market by Application: Hypermarkets/Supermarkets</h2> <p>Hypermarkets and supermarkets have long been key retail outlets for consumer products, including baby care and monitoring devices. In the context of the smart nursery and monitor market, these stores offer a wide variety of products in one place, appealing to parents who prefer convenience and the ability to physically assess products before purchasing. Hypermarkets and supermarkets stock smart nursery monitors alongside other baby-related products, providing consumers with an accessible, one-stop shopping experience.
